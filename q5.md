5.1. Describe what each program snippet does to compute its results.
```
#Approach 1
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')
```

The function generates a list of doubled values from 0 to n - 1 through a normal for loop. For each index from 0 to n-1, it is multiplied by 2 and then appended to the res list.

```
#Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')
```

This function uses list comprehension to generate a list and apply the logic of *2 to each elentment in the list, then prints the list.

```
#Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : ')
```

This function generates the same thing as the function in approach 1. The difference is the "yield" keyword, which is used to create a generator function. Values are created but not saved as a list in memory.

5.2. What type of function is `doubleG(n)`? What is the advantage of using such a function?
Since `doubleG(n)` uses keyword "yiel", it is a generator function. The advantage of it is that it generates values one at a time, rather than creating and storing the entire sequence in memory.
This can be more memory-efficient, especially when working with large datasets. It also iterates without the need to generate the entire sequence from the begining, which can lead to faster execution.
